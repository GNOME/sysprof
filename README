Sysprof is a sampling profiler that uses a kernel module to generate
stacktraces which are then interpreted by the userspace program
"sysprof".

See the Sysprof homepage:

for more information

Questions, patches and bug reports should be sent to the sysprof
mailing list:

Debugging symbols

- The programs and libraries you want to profile should be compiled
  with -fno-omit-frame-pointer and have debugging symbols available,
  or you won't get much usable information.


Building Sysprof
----------------

You need some packages installed. The package names may vary depending on your
distribution, the following command works on Fedora 25:

    sudo dnf install gcc make autoconf automake autopoint libtool ghc-gio

Then do the following:

    ./autogen.sh   # configure, generate makefiles etc.
    make           # Build the code
    make install   # Install (default prefix /usr/local)

WARNING: `make install` will mostly install under the configured install prefix
but installs systemd service configuration directly in the system default
location `/usr/lib/systemd` so it won't work without root privileges, even if
the install prefix is a user-owned directory.
