This is a sampling profiler that uses a kernel module, sysprof-module,
to generate stacktraces which are then interpreted by the userspace
program "sysprof".

- The profiler uses a kernel module, so it is Linux specifc

- There is no auto* stuff. Just type "make" and hope for the best.

- You need gtk+ 2.4.0 or better, and you need libglade

- Thanks to Kristian Høgsberg, it now works on the 2.6 kernel.
