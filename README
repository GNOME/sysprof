This is a sampling profiler that uses a kernel module, sysprof-module,
to generate stacktraces which are then interpreted by the userspace
program "sysprof".

- The profiler uses a kernel module, so it is Linux specifc

- There is no auto* stuff. Just type "make" and hope for the best.

- It does not work on Linux 2.6. Feel free to port it and send me the
  patch.

- You need gtk+ 2.4.0 or better, and you need libglade
