This is a sampling profiler that uses a kernel module, sysprof-module,
to generate stacktraces which are then interpreted by the userspace
program "sysprof".

- There is no auto* stuff. Just type "make" and hope for the best

- You need gtk+ 2.4.0 or better. If you are using gtk+ 2.5 or greater,
  you also need libglade cvs HEAD.

- You need a 2.6 kernel

- The programs you want to profile should have debugging symbols, or
  you won't get much usable information. On a Fedora Core system,
  installing the relevant -debuginfo packages should do the trick.

- To get usable data on the X server:

  (1) Compile the X server to use ".so" modules:

	- Uncomment the line "MakeDllModules	Yes" in 
	  xc/config/cf/xorgsite.def

	- "make World"

  (2) Install the X server making sure it can't see any ".a" files. If
      you install on top of an existing installation, just do

	  find /usr/X11R6/lib/"*.a" | sudo xargs rm

      and install the newly compiled X server. 

      If a ".so" X server finds .a files in its module path it will
      try to load those in preference to .so files and this causes
      symbol resolution problems

  (3) Run your new X server

  (4) Run sysprof as root. This is necessary because the X server binary 
      for security reasons is not readable by regular users. I could tell
      you why, but then I'd have to kill you.
