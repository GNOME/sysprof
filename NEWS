   scenarios where <> and :: should be used.
 * The D-Bus section has gained support for search filtering.

 * SysprofCollector will now try much harder for the peer to process
   the mmap ring buffer before bailing so that the leak collector is
   less likely to drop records.
 * Sysprof now uses gtktimsort to sort records for a significant speed
   improvement when loading large captures.
 * Window titles now include documen title.
 * Reduction in number of samples to normalize for various charts which
   results in faster loading times. You can continue to zoom in to get
   better details.
 * A new scheduler details instrument is provided, which uses tracepoints
   to track when processes were running and on what CPU.
 * A new flamegraph is added for viewing profiling results. It is powered
   by the same callgraph seen in the callgraph view, which means changes to
   the callgraph can influence the flamegraph. Colorization is provided
   by stack categorization in callgraphs.
 * Categorization of Kernel symbols has been fixed.
 * Callgraphs are now sorted incrementally to help keep the UI responsive
   while loading the document.

   counting summary values when recursion is used.
 * A fix for a crash when pivoting to a new root in the callgraph.
 * A new option to merge similar processes when generating callgraphs.
 * A new option to filter out kernel processes has been added. This feature
   is quite rudimentary and involves commandline sniffing. Improvements
   are requested by those seeking more comprehensive filtering.
 * Improvements to locating and symbolizing Flatpak processes.
 * The files section has gained search filter support.

Happy Hacking!

Overview of changes in Sysprof 45.beta
=======================================

Sysprof has largely been redesigned and rewriten from the ground up this cycle
to provide better GTK 4 integration and more advanced features.

libsysprof-capture
------------------

This library is our static library used by many applications and libraries to
augment capture collection. It is still installed as libsysprof-capture-4.a
as a static library for consumers. The ABI is the same, however some new data
types have been added.

libsysprof
----------

This library has been rewritten around a new document model for captures.
Instead of using SysprofCaptureReader (a buffered capture reader) the
SysprofDocument object exposes a GListModel of a mmap()'d capture file.

This has allowed for many new indexing performance improvements as well
as simpler data-binding in the user interface.

You can read more about this at
https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2023/07/18/glistmodel-as-a-data-format/

Additionally, a new SysprofProfiler API has been added. It has been much
simplified and allows for easier implementation of instruments in a race
free manner.

The library heavily builds upon libdex for Futures which I created this past
window to simplify features in GNOME Builder.

sysprof-cli and sysprof-agent
-----------------------------

These tools both provide similar features albeit from a different standpoint.
They have both been updated to use the new profiler interface in libsysprof.

sysprofd
--------

Very minimal changes have been made to sysprofd to help ensure that the
application and libraries can still work on systems with an older sysprofd
installed on the host.

sysprof
-------

The application has been completely redesigned and is now window focused
rather than tabs. The constraint of tabs was becoming too cumbersome to
maintain so as the author, I felt this was the right move.

Howto and More
--------------

I wrote a series of blog posts on how to use Sysprof which you might
find useful.

   into Sysprof.
 * Port Sysprof to work on RHEL 7

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.33.3
=====================================

This release of Sysprof contains the largest amount of work since we revived
the project a few years ago. We have revamped and minimized the ABI of
libsysprof-ui considerably. As port of the ABI update, symbols have been
changed from Sp to Sysprof to reduce chances of collisions.

With these changes comes a soname bump and upgrade of the D-Bus API provided
by the package. Some work has been taken to implement older versions of the
sysprofd API so that older clients may continue to work.

 • Various build system improvements
 • A new libsysprof-capture-3.a capture library has been provided to allow
   application developers to capture data and merge into the profiler stream.
 • The recording and viewing API has been redesigned and improved.
 • Sysprof has been backported to support GTK 3.22 and GLib 2.50.
 • Support for passing file-descriptors has been added to allow profiling
   integration with GNOME Shell, GJS, and GTK profilers.
 • New API to allow integration with external tooling that spawns applications
   is provided so that environment and arguments may be modified.
 • A new re-record feature has been added.
 • The capture format can now store log messages, metadata, and file content.
 • A new org.gnome.Sysprof3 daemon has been added, which is written using
   GDBus instead of libsystemd. This may improve portability to some
   distributions.
 • The portability of Sysprof to non-Linux systems has been improved, however
   many recording features are still not available on non-Linux platforms.
 • A new org.gnome.Sysprof3.Profiler XML D-Bus interface is provided for
   tooling that wants to export Sysprof content via D-Bus.
 • Various new capture sources have been provided.
 • sysprofd also implements a compat org.gnome.Sysprof2 D-Bus end-point
   for older clients.
 • Translation updates

Happy Profiling,

-- Christian
