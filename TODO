 - Follow fork/threads

   Currently, when watching a pid, we do not have a way to follow forks.
   We need to watch FORK/EXIT events and create/dispose additional perf
   streams from the kernel.

 - Add cpu/mem/net data source

 - Add frame types for generic counters

 - Add support for visualizations other than the callgraph.

   1) I'd like to see a graph of call depth over time.
   2) line graphs for cpu/mem/net.
   3) disk I/O

   etc.

   One quick way to put together the UI is to just use ListBox for the
   rows. Then we need a "graph" child that allows drawing. The nice thing
   here is that we get pixel caching for free. Resizing the row height
   gets a little annoying though.
