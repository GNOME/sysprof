Sysprof Linux Profiler v. 1.0.10


* What is it?
--------------------------

Sysprof is a sampling system-wide CPU profiler for Linux.

Sysprof uses a Linux kernel module to profile the entire system, not
just an individual application. Sysprof handles threads and shared
libraries, and applications do not have to be recompiled or
instrumented. In fact they don't even have to be restarted.


* Features:
----------------------

    - Profiles all running processes, not just a single application

    - Call graph support showing time spent in each branch of the call tree

    - Has a simple graphical interface

    - Profiles can be loaded and saved

    - Easy to use: Just insert the kernel module and start sysprof

    - Supports Fedora debuginfo packages


* Sysprof 1.0.10
--------------------------

    - Compiles with Linux 2.6.25
