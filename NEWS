Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.33.3
=====================================

This release of Sysprof contains the largest amount of work since we revived
the project a few years ago. We have revamped and minimized the ABI of
libsysprof-ui considerably. As port of the ABI update, symbols have been
changed from Sp to Sysprof to reduce chances of collisions.

With these changes comes a soname bump and upgrade of the D-Bus API provided
by the package. Some work has been taken to implement older versions of the
sysprofd API so that older clients may continue to work.

 • Various build system improvements
 • A new libsysprof-capture-3.a capture library has been provided to allow
   application developers to capture data and merge into the profiler stream.
 • The recording and viewing API has been redesigned and improved.
 • Sysprof has been backported to support GTK 3.22 and GLib 2.50.
 • Support for passing file-descriptors has been added to allow profiling
   integration with GNOME Shell, GJS, and GTK profilers.
 • New API to allow integration with external tooling that spawns applications
   is provided so that environment and arguments may be modified.
 • A new re-record feature has been added.
 • The capture format can now store log messages, metadata, and file content.
 • A new org.gnome.Sysprof3 daemon has been added, which is written using
   GDBus instead of libsystemd. This may improve portability to some
   distributions.
 • The portability of Sysprof to non-Linux systems has been improved, however
   many recording features are still not available on non-Linux platforms.
 • A new org.gnome.Sysprof3.Profiler XML D-Bus interface is provided for
   tooling that wants to export Sysprof content via D-Bus.
 • Various new capture sources have been provided.
 • sysprofd also implements a compat org.gnome.Sysprof2 D-Bus end-point
   for older clients.
 • Translation updates

Happy Profiling,
