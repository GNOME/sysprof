"A profiler is an application that records information about an application "

"into how the application could be changed to perform better."

"Two common categories of software profilers exist, commonly referred to as "
"either tracing or sampling profilers. What is meant by tracing profiler is "
"that every function call executed by the program is known to the profiler. A "
"sampling profiler works by inspecting the state of the program on a regular "
"frequency and therefore does not see every function call executed by the "
"program."

msgid ""
"Both tracing and sampling profilers have their advantages. A notable "
"advtantage of a sampling profiler is that the overhead is much less than "
"that of a tracing profiler, making it easier to use for software that "
"requires interactivity."
