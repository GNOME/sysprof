This is a sampling profiler that uses a kernel module, sysprof-module,
to generate stacktraces which are then interpreted by the userspace
program "sysprof".

- The profiler uses a kernel module, so it is Linux specifc

- There is no auto* stuff. Just type "make" and hope for the best.

- You need gtk+ 2.4.0 or better, and you need libglade

- You need a 2.6 non-SMP kernel

- It is known to be broken on SMP kernels. Patches gladly accepted.

- The programs you want to profile should have debugging symbols, or
  you won't get much useful information.

- To get symbols from the X server, run sysprof as root (go figure).
