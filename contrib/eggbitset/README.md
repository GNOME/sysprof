Roaring bitmaps implementation
==============================

This directory contains code modified for GTK, based on the Roaring
bitmaps reference implementation
[CRoaring](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring).

It is not necessarily compatible with past or future versions of CRoaring,
and replacing it with a different version or linking to a system copy
is not supported.

See the source files for copyright and licensing information, and the
`COPYING` file for the full text of the Apache license, version 2.0.

When proposing modifications for these files, please consider whether they
are also suitable for submission to CRoaring.
