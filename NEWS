Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.36.0
=====================================

 * Preload library has been moved to $libdir from $libexecdir
 * Build system improvements
 * Fix whole-system capture setting when using "Record Again" feature
 * New SysprofCollector interfaces for samples, marks, and logs to
   sit alongside allocations
 * Translation updates

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.35.92
======================================

 * A new profiler for tracking memory allocations within processes
   that are spawned by Sysprof. Select "Track Allocations" to use
   an LD_PRELOAD module which monitors allocations within the target
   process. A callgraph is provided with allocations and their stack
   traces. This brings the main features of the venerable "Memprof"
   into Sysprof.
 * Port Sysprof to work on RHEL 7
 * Improvements to marks and counters displays
 * A new data frame in libsysprof-capture for memory allocations
   with stack traces.
 * sysprof-cli --merge can now be used to merge multiple syscap
   files together.
 * sysprof <program-path> can now be used to open Sysprof directly
   to a program to execute.
 * Sysprof now builds with additional security protections and
   optimization flags such as -Bsymbolic, -Wl,-z,defs, -Wl,-z,now,
   and -Wl,-z,relro.
 * Fixes for macOS
 * The ELF symbol resolver is faster
 * sysprof-cli now properly adds supplemental information to the
   capture file such as decoded symbols. This makes sharing syscap
   files across machines easier and more reliable.
 * A new mmap()'d ring buffer can be shared between processes for
   faster data transfer to sysprof. We expect more features around
   this SysprofCollector interface in future releases.
 * A new set if icons has been provided for the collectors
 * Translation updates

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.35.2
=====================================

 * Build and test fixes
 * Track changes to gdbus-codegen
 * Include additional pkg-config variable for access to D-Bus data
 * Translation updates

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.34.1
=====================================

 * Process search fixes

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.34.0
=====================================

 * Help fixes
 * Build and test fixes
 * Translation updates

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.33.92
======================================

 • Check for GLib 2.61.3 or newer for features used when removing deprecated
   API usage from GLib.
 • Require meson 0.50
 • Translation updates

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.33.90
======================================

 • Tweak CSS styling a bit
 • Hide RAPL rows if no counters were discovered
 • Fix --no-battery in sysprof-cli
 • Improve parsing of /proc/mounts and /proc/pid/mountinfo
 • Improve support for using libsysprof from Flatpak
 • Symbol directories are removed from public ABI and consumers should
   now add directories to SysprofElfSymbolResolver directly

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.33.4
=====================================

 • Build system fixes and improved backports
 • New network, disk, battery, and energy sources
 • Additional options for sysprof-cli including "syprof-cli -- command"
   support.
 • i18n is now properly initialized at startup
 • Improved styling
 • A new "duplex" graph type for read/write type visuals

Overview of changes in Sysprof 3.33.3
=====================================

This release of Sysprof contains the largest amount of work since we revived
the project a few years ago. We have revamped and minimized the ABI of
libsysprof-ui considerably. As port of the ABI update, symbols have been
changed from Sp to Sysprof to reduce chances of collisions.

With these changes comes a soname bump and upgrade of the D-Bus API provided
by the package. Some work has been taken to implement older versions of the
sysprofd API so that older clients may continue to work.

 • Various build system improvements
 • A new libsysprof-capture-3.a capture library has been provided to allow
   application developers to capture data and merge into the profiler stream.
 • The recording and viewing API has been redesigned and improved.
 • Sysprof has been backported to support GTK 3.22 and GLib 2.50.
 • Support for passing file-descriptors has been added to allow profiling
   integration with GNOME Shell, GJS, and GTK profilers.
 • New API to allow integration with external tooling that spawns applications
   is provided so that environment and arguments may be modified.
 • A new re-record feature has been added.
 • The capture format can now store log messages, metadata, and file content.
 • A new org.gnome.Sysprof3 daemon has been added, which is written using
   GDBus instead of libsystemd. This may improve portability to some
   distributions.
 • The portability of Sysprof to non-Linux systems has been improved, however
   many recording features are still not available on non-Linux platforms.
 • A new org.gnome.Sysprof3.Profiler XML D-Bus interface is provided for
   tooling that wants to export Sysprof content via D-Bus.
 • Various new capture sources have been provided.
 • sysprofd also implements a compat org.gnome.Sysprof2 D-Bus end-point
   for older clients.
 • Translation updates

Happy Profiling,
