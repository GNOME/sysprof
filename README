Sysprof is a sampling profiler that uses a kernel module to generate
stacktraces which are then interpreted by the userspace program
"sysprof".

See the Sysprof homepage:

Questions, patches and bug reports should be sent to the sysprof

Debugging symbols

- The programs and libraries you want to profile should be compiled
  with -fno-omit-frame-pointer and have debugging symbols available,
  or you won't get much usable information.
